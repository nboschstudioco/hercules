# Gmail Extension Follow Up Read Me
Gmail Auto Follow-Up Chrome Extension
Overview
This Chrome extension lets users automate Gmail follow-up sequences using a standalone extension popup. All enrollment and management is handled in the extension interface, using the Gmail API for stability and reliability.
Step-by-Step Development Plan
1 Set Up Gmail API Credentials
	* Create a project in Google Cloud Console.
	* Enable the Gmail API.
	* Configure OAuth consent screen.
	* Create OAuth credentials and obtain the Client ID.
2 Implement OAuth Authentication
	* Add authentication flow to the extension popup so users can log in to their Gmail account and grant API permissions.
	* Display a simple confirmation of successful login (e.g., show user's email address).
3 Fetch Email List (Sent/Drafts)
	* Use the access token to fetch a list of sent and/or draft emails via the Gmail API.
	* Display key metadata (subject, recipient, date) in the popup UI.
4 Enroll and Manage Sequences
	* Allow user to select emails and configure follow-up sequences.
	* Schedule, send, and monitor sequence status entirely in the extension popup.
5 Handle Replies, Pausing, and Status
	* Monitor enrolled threads for replies and pause follow-ups if needed.
	* Display current status for all managed threads.

⠀Getting Started
* Use Replit workspace for all code development.
* Follow the plan above one step at a time—do not proceed until each step is working and reviewed.
