Critical Areas to Inspect and Fix
1. Origin Mismatch in postMessage Handling
Your extension's waitForAuthResult listener does:

js
if (event.origin !== backendUrl) {
    console.log('... REJECTING message from origin:', event.origin, 'expected:', backendUrl);
    return;
}
Problem:

backendUrl (from apiClient.getBackendUrl()) must match exactly (including protocol, subdomain, and port) the origin string of the message sent from the backend popup.

E.g., if your backend is at http://localhost:3000 but the popup’s origin is reported as http://127.0.0.1:3000, or vice versa (or one is https, one is http), your extension will reject all valid messages.

Solution:

Print/debug both event.origin and backendUrl on a real sign-in attempt.

Ensure your backend popup uses the unambiguous, browser-friendly hostname (localhost preferred over 127.0.0.1) and protocol.

The postMessage sender (in /auth/success) and the receiver in the extension must agree exactly.

2. Listener is in a Proper UI Context and Attached Before OAuth
You are correctly attaching the message handler as soon as the popup opens:

js
window.addEventListener('message', messageListener);
Problem:

If your extension UI reloads, reloads the sidepanel, or if the event listener is detached before the popup completes, you will miss the message.

Solution:

Double-check that the listener stays attached until the actual timeout, and that no browser navigation or sidepanel reload breaks the context.

Watch for any console logs that indicate the listener is cleaning up prematurely.

3. postMessage is Actually Sent from Backend Before Window Close
In /auth/success, the code must run:

js
window.opener.postMessage({ type: 'oauth_success', token: "...", user: {...} }, "*");
setTimeout(() => window.close(), 1500);
Problem:

It MUST be posted from the right origin (matching your extension's backendUrl).

If the popup is not opened by the extension window (e.g., via direct open or a navigation redirect), window.opener might be null.

Solution:

Ensure /auth/success logs something to the console to prove that postMessage ran, and print out the intended data and window.opener.

4. Session Cookie/CORS Issues on Backend
If your backend (running on localhost:3000) and frontend (extension) have inconsistent CORS headers or the browser blocks cookies/cross-origin requests, event.origin or the transport itself might fail.

Solution:

Make sure all CORS responses from the backend allow http://localhost (or your actual extension, if running from a packed path).

Temporarily set your event.origin check to console.log/bypass for debugging, to see if this is the source of the rejection:

js
// Accept any localhost:3000-style origin for debugging
if (!/^http:\/\/localhost:3000$/.test(event.origin)) {
    // or, in dev, just accept and log all origins
    // PRODUCTION: Lock this down
}
Debugging Steps
Log both in the popup (/auth/success):

Send console.log with the postMessage data and window.opener info.

Log in extension (sidepanel.js):

Print every event.origin, expectedOrigin, and data. Confirm if any message is received (“Extension: Received message event” log).

Temporarily relax the origin check (for a single test):
