OAuth flow reaches success endpoint, but extension displays “user did not approve access”

Message:

The backend successfully completes OAuth:

State is validated

Token and user info are issued

The browser is redirected to /auth/success?token=...

However, the extension UI and handleSignIn logic frequently show an error:

text
Sign-in error: Error: The user did not approve access.
Please review and update the following:

Front-end OAuth Event Handling:

Ensure that the extension correctly awaits and receives the final redirect and its parameters from /auth/success.

Confirm that the extension does not throw 'Authentication cancelled' unless the actual Google consent/popup is denied or closed early.

Cross-check timing: if the popup closes before completion, surface the correct error message. On actual success, parse and store the token/user info as intended.

Error Catch and Interpretation:

Audit all places where 'Authentication cancelled' or "user did not approve access" are thrown.

Only show this error if the Google consent really failed—not after a valid /auth/success redirect.

Popup/Flow Lifecycle:

Confirm the extension UI only considers authentication cancelled if:

The OAuth window is closed before Google responds,

Or Google returns an access_denied/denied response.

Otherwise, report success and transition to authenticated UI.

Server-Extension Callback:

Ensure the extension can receive and interpret the redirect with token and user parameters.

Document for the extension devs the exact parameters and expected flow for this endpoint.

Acceptance:

If Google consent is given, extension UI should update to show signed-in user/email (no auth error).

If denied, cancelled, or error from Google, extension should show "authentication error."

Please review both extension and backend code for authentication flow completion, and log/trace the values passed during the /auth/success redirect. This will ensure the UI accurately reflects the true outcome of each authentication attempt.
