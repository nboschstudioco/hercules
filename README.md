Gmail Auto Follow-Up Extension
Context
This Chrome extension is built for the new Chrome extension side panel, offering a spacious, persistent UI for automating Gmail follow-ups. Users authenticate, design reusable message sequences, batch-select sent emails, and enroll those emails into preconfigured sequences via the side panel interface.

Core Features
Side Panel UI:

Entire app interface (authentication, sequence design, email selection/enrollment, status dashboard) runs inside the extensionâ€™s side panel, not the popup.

More screen space for advanced configuration and usability.

OAuth Authentication: Secure Google/Gmail login.

Recent Sent Emails: Fetch, display, and select emails in the side panel.

Reusable Sequence Designer: Create, review, edit, and delete named sequences (with up to 4 steps and variants).

Batch Enrollment: Select emails, pick sequence from dropdown, and enroll with one click.

Enrollment Overview: View all enrolled emails and manage status/actions.

Scheduler/Automation: Automatically send follow-ups on schedule and monitor replies to update status.
