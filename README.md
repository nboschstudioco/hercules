Gmail Auto Follow-Up Extension
Context
This Chrome extension allows users to automate Gmail follow-ups by enrolling sent emails into preconfigured message sequences. Users authenticate via OAuth, view recent sent emails, select one or more emails using checkboxes, and enroll chosen messages into a stored follow-up sequence. Sequence configuration is managed once by the user/admin in a settings panel, ensuring rapid enrollment at the point of need.

Core Features
OAuth Authentication: Secure Google login to enable Gmail API access.
(Complete)

Email Fetching with Multi-Select: Display recent sent emails with checkboxes for multi-select.
(Complete)

Admin Sequence Configuration Panel:

Add/edit/delete follow-up sequences in a dedicated settings panel.

Each sequence can have up to 4 steps, 1–3 plain-text variants per step, and custom scheduling (business days/hours and gaps between steps).

Sequences are named and saved for dropdown selection at enrollment.

Bulk Email Enrollment:

User selects one or more emails with checkboxes.

User is prompted (modal or inline) to choose one preconfigured sequence from a dropdown.

After confirming ("Enroll" button), all selected emails are scheduled for follow-up based on the chosen sequence parameters.

Enrollment Status:

Dashboard lists enrolled emails and assigned sequence names.

Shows current status (Pending/Active/Paused/Completed).

User can pause, un-enroll, or reassign sequence.
